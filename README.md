As a backend developer, I thought of going with HTML/TailwindCSS/JS for the frontend and ExpressJS as the backend. But after some thought, I decided to try out HTMX. I checked their website and they linked this book [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/). I decided to buy the book and sat down to read it. This was the first time I went in depth about hypermedia systems. 

I was surprised after learning about how many stuffs can be natively handled by the browsers. This is where I was introduced to the concept of HATEOAS as well, So I decided to go the HTMX route. The backend is ExpressJS with PostgresSQL database. I wanted to keep it simple because now my main focus about this project was to better understand Hypermedia Systems, HATEOAS and the true nature of RESTfull APIs.
